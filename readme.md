`scripts/` contains:
  - A parser which takes data from [TEPCat](http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/jkt/tepcat/) and converts it into json

Some other data sources could be:
  - http://exoplanet.eu/
  - http://exoplanets.org/
  - http://var2.astro.cz/ETD/
  - http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog/data/database

`playground/` contains, for now, a series of scripts to play around with the data and with matplotlib
